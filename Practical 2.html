  <h1 align="center"><u>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</u></h1>
<p style="font-size:25px;">Shivaji I (Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale; Marathi pronunciation: 
[. 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680] was 
an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan. Shivaji
 carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi 
 Sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire.
 In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad 
 Fort.
Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries
 after his death he began to take on increased importance with the emergence 
 of the Indian independence movement, as many Indian nationalists elevated
 him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.</p>
